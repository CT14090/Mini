Description: Design pressure ratings, wind load data, and structural calculations

CRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR DESIGN_PRESSURE:
✅ Use CLEAR TECHNICAL DIAGRAMS only
✅ Avoid text-heavy images or paragraphs
✅ Include various styles and scales  
✅ Minimum size: 300x300 pixels
✅ Focus on visual/graphical content

Specific for design_pressure:

- Wind load diagrams with pressure indicators
- Structural load calculations and charts
- Pressure distribution diagrams
- Wind pressure rating charts

Examples that work well:
- CAD drawings and technical illustrations
- Cross-sectional details and assembly diagrams
- Performance charts and specification diagrams
- Clear, professional technical drawings

Examples to AVOID:
- Text paragraphs or specifications
- Blurry or low-quality images
- Screenshots with mostly text
- Images without clear technical content

The enhanced system specifically detects:
- Technical lines and precise geometry
- Construction-specific patterns
- Diagram vs text content
- Professional technical drawing elements
